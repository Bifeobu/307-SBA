This project is essentially a website about selling baked goods but is called “Baked Great” because the product is better than good.
The website was made to jump from the first page to the third page with different interactions. The ‘login’ and/or ‘create’ button is supposed to allow you to go to page two. The ‘shop GREATS’ dropdown is supposed to allow you to go to page three.
The languages used were HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
